# Housing_prices-Regression

Group members: Ananda Gowda, Jingqi Feng

In this project, we want to predict housing prices according to provided housing information using linear regression. By cleaning and encoding data set, determining the most correlated variables, and employing polynomial regression models with different degree, we find a suitable model to capture the correlation between the sale prices with the predictor variables.

Instructions of installing the package requirements:
conda create --name NEWENV --file requirements.txt

Scope and limitations:
1. The data collection might invade the privacy of the house owners and selling agencies.
2. Potential extensions: applying different regression models such as XGBoost, Ridge, and Lasso Regression.
